There are too many unacceptable methods in advertising today.

How often do you watch TV or hang out on social media?
Have you noticed how quickly advertising adapts to your requests?
Yesterday you were looking for tours to Turkey, and today the whole tape is in the advertising of five-star hotels.
Well, today I will tell you about several unacceptable methods of advertisers to impose their product.
So, since we started with the so-called "wiretapping", I can say that this method can be really frightening.
Advertisers literally break into your personal life, rummage through it, probably receiving data from providers about visited sites, and impose their offers on you.
Moreover, advertising agencies often, possibly illegally, receive data from your mobile phones and call with offers of their products.
This is simply outrageous!
But not very knowledgeable people do not consider this a disaster.
Someone might say that, really, we leave the same personal data freely available, so it's not difficult to get them.
Yes, but we leave them to someone specific for a reason, such as a store, and not to third-party people, right?
We can say that advertising is trying to find the product we need, but nevertheless, they collect data not only on their site, but from all the visited links.
All in all, nowadays advertising has too much access to personal data, and I think this should be abolished.
