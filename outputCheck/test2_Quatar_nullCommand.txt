Before oil was discovered on the territory of Qatar, it was the extraction of pearls that was one of the main sources of income in the region, so it is still valued by residents today.
We visited, we will walk 3 blocks and go to the National Museum of Qatar.
The exhibits are dedicated to the history and heritage of the country, and are designed to glorify its past, present, and future on the world stage: three chapters "The Beginning", "Life in Qatar" and "Modern History of Qatar".
And finally, leaving the museum, you need to catch a boat and go to Banana Island.
It is a crescent-shaped island with blue waters, tropical plants, and a golden beach 800 meters long.
Do not forget that we came for football, so when planning a trip to Qatar, it is worth considering that this country has a very strict mentality, and it is worth familiarizing yourself with the rules of visiting.
Look at the slide, are there any rules that seem strange for you?
That's the end of our training camps in Qatar for the World Cup, I hope you have remembered something for yourself that you will consider during a long trip to the southern country.
(Yes, you ride like this every week, right?).
Thank you for your attention
